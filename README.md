Estimating the age of the Universe.

Check out The Hubble Constant and the Age of the Universe.ipynb. It's a Jupyter notebook walking through a calculation of the Hubble Constant and the age of the universe using Cepheid galaxies. For some reason, Github takes issue with the latex rendering in the notebook. This should correct itself if you download the notebook.

I've become aware that this process is used as an assignment in quite a few university courses. Of course, I'm happy that people are using this for inspiration, but blatant plagiarism will always be discovered by your lecturers because, surprise surprise: they aren't stupid, and they know where to look. Use your common sense, and if you have any doubts, please clarify with your lecturers.
